# phase-1-js-toy-problem
 for my problem i created 4 file that is three javascript file for each solution
and one html file for displaying output  and taking users input for each problem 
divided into sections
## HTML
this is the index.html file
basicaly linking the the javasript files so as to have where to take input from
as well as displaying and linking with google fonts and a bit of styling 
## JavaScript solutions
All my javaScript files have one thing in common and this is the fact that the 
take input from html and display the result there through the use of eventlisteners
where i embed my every other function within it so mtha when the event happens my
function gets invoked and displays the output 
### Challenge one
the challenge one solution is in a file named challengeOne.js, which provides the 
grading solution for scores entered between 0 and 100 anything else doesn't qualify
to be gradded the grades are provide for the marks entered when it grades acoordingly
### Challenge two
the solution is provided in a file named challengeTwo.js to the code essentialy checks for 
the car speed and sees whether yo have demerit points or you are okay or the liscence have
been suspended depending on the speed entred
### Challenge Three
the last third challege and the solution i placed it in the challengeThree.js file its 
about the  net salary itb starts by claculating the nhif figures which is done in its 
own function then its output  is assined to the nhif variable 
the  we move to the net salary calculator that calcultes payee first then does the deductions
from the gross salary that is taken as user input  which is displayed as the solution

## Conclusion 
1. I applied the use of event listeners 
2. Linked html to all my JS files for input and output
3. Styled my html to be a bit pleasing i applied flex
